    "- Two One-Of Types\n",
    "    - In this module, we will learn to design functions consuming two arguments which are one-of types. In order to do this, we will develop a new model of our code, the cross product of the types comment table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The cross product of the types comment table first provides us with a way to clearly think of all possible test cases. We will then find it helps us get a basis for what our function's body will look like -- and even allow us to simplify it -- all before we even start coding. In this sense, it plays a role similar to the role of type comments and templates -- and in fact extends our idea of templating from simply what we copy from the types comments to what it really is; a method of knowing a great deal about what code will look like before we start coding details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 3-5 hours of dedicated time to complete.\n",

    "- Learning Goals\n",
    "    - Be able to produce the cross-product of type templates table for a function operating on two values with one-of types.\n",
    "    - Be able to use the table to generate examples and a template.\n",
    "    - Be able to use the table to simplify the function when there are equal answers in some cells."

    "This video focuses almost entirely on the examples for the chart function. This provides a good example of the incremental process of working out more complex image producing functions and also reinforces why we do the recipe steps in the order we do. Even though this video does not address the reference rule directly it is absolutely essential that you watch it before part 3.\n",

    "- Eva is trying to decide where to go to university. One important factor for tuition costs. Eva is a visual thinker, and has taken Systematic Program Design so she decides to design a program that will help her visualize the costs at different schools. She decides to start simply, knowing she can revise her design later.\n",

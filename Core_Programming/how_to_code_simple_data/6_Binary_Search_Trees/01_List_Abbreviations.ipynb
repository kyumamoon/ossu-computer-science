    "By now you may be finding the notation we are using for lists somewhat cumbersome, with all the repeated conses we have to write. In this short video we will see a new notation for lists that is less cumbersome to type out. It is important to remember that this notation is just an abbreviation for the cons notation. Lists are still made up of conses, and we will still be using first and rest take lists apart. We will still be using cons to add a single element to the front of a list.\n",
